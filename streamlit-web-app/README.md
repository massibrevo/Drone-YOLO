Every week we create tutorials showing you the best new updates in Computer Vision. üî•
[Subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/@Roboflow), and stay up to date with our latest YouTube videos!

## How it Works:

## üíª run locally
Complete these steps with your console/terminal
```
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/roboflow/streamlit-web-app.git
```
```
# navigate to the root directory
cd streamlit-web-app
cd streamlit
```
```
# set up your python environment and activate it
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
```
# install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
# run the app
streamlit run Home.py
```

### Troubleshooting:
* For Mac users: be sure that you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
* Unable to resolve wheel for `av` or `aiortc` packages: Install `pkg-config` by executing `brew install pkg-config` in your Terminal
* If you wish to process video streams with Streamlit apps, be sure to also have `ffmpeg` installed: after installing Homebrew, execute `brew install ffmpeg` in your Terminal

-- Check here for more on `ffmpeg` installation: https://github.com/roboflow/video-inference#requirements
* Ensure that you have `opencv-python-headless` installed in your environment, instead of `opencv-python`

* Unable to install the `av` package with `pip`? Try executing `conda install av -c conda-forge` in your Terminal

-- Note: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is required for this method. Be sure that `conda-forge` has been made available in your channels. https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html#how-can-i-install-packages-from-conda-forge

## Next Steps:
1. Customize the app further for your use case: https://docs.streamlit.io
2. Create another custom app or solution with your model
3. Create new models. Need inspiration? [Try searching Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com)
4. Getting false detections? Model not performing to your expectations? Try Active Learning (Smart Sampling) and improving your Dataset Health:
