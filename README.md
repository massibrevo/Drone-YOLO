## ðŸŽ¬ Overview

This application is developed as part of a Master's thesis in Computational Engineering and Mathematics, focusing on using deep learning and computer vision to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of search and rescue operations through aerial imagery analysis.

## How it Works:
I've created this Streamlit app that allows users to upload aerial images and uses a trained YOLOv8 model to detect and localize missing individuals in forested or challenging terrains.

## ðŸ’» run locally
Complete these steps with your console/terminal
```
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/roboflow/streamlit-web-app.git
```
```
# navigate to the root directory
cd streamlit-web-app
cd streamlit
```
```
# set up your python environment and activate it
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
```
# install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
# run the app
streamlit run Home.py
```

### Troubleshooting:
* For Mac users: be sure that you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
* Unable to resolve wheel for `av` or `aiortc` packages: Install `pkg-config` by executing `brew install pkg-config` in your Terminal
* If you wish to process video streams with Streamlit apps, be sure to also have `ffmpeg` installed: after installing Homebrew, execute `brew install ffmpeg` in your Terminal

-- Check here for more on `ffmpeg` installation: https://github.com/roboflow/video-inference#requirements
* Ensure that you have `opencv-python-headless` installed in your environment, instead of `opencv-python`

* Unable to install the `av` package with `pip`? Try executing `conda install av -c conda-forge` in your Terminal

-- Note: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is required for this method. Be sure that `conda-forge` has been made available in your channels. https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html#how-can-i-install-packages-from-conda-forge
